What happens when you initialize a repository? Why fo you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, it sets the staging area and allows for the possibility to track file using git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows us to selectively commit a series of files while ignoring others in a single commit. This gives us greater control over our commits and therefore our workflow.
