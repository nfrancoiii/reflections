When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This will be a useful feature when working as part of a team, a larger open-source project, or from various locations or computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automativally stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on commits that are not ready for distribution with the wider group so you want to wait until things have been sufficiently vetted.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are exclusively GitHub terminology and describe when you take a clone of another person's work on git hub and make a copy for yourself. Clones are making a copy on your local machine either from your github repository or another repository on your machine. Branches are different versions of your main code.
